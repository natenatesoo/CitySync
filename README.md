# CitySync

**Civic participation infrastructure for local communities.**

CitySync is an on-chain system that turns verified civic actions into redeemable credits — connecting residents, local organizations, and community businesses in a closed-loop economy of contribution and access.

---

## What It Does

Residents earn **CITY** (civic credits) by completing verified community tasks — volunteering, attending events, participating in local governance. Those credits are redeemable with local businesses and services as tangible rewards.

**Three roles:**
- **Participant** — Complete tasks, earn credits, vote on community initiatives, redeem rewards
- **Issuer** — Organizations that post tasks and verify completions (nonprofits, city departments, civic orgs)
- **Redeemer** — Local businesses and services that accept CITY credits in exchange for goods or discounts

**Three on-chain assets:**
- `CITY` — Soul-bound civic credit (ERC-20, non-transferable)
- `VOTE` — Soul-bound governance token (ERC-20Votes, non-transferable)
- `MCE` — Soul-bound credit for community event participation

## Try the Demo

Live at **[demo.city-sync.org](https://demo.city-sync.org)**

The interactive demo lets you explore all three roles with simulated state — no wallet required. Credits earned as a Participant are spendable at Redeemer offers. Issuer verifications increment real stats. Cross-role state is shared.
