They are earned through civic-labor contributions and spent on access to public goods and services. This keeps the system grounded in real civic value rather than through market dynamics.",
  body2:
    "For this economy to function sustainably, the rate at which credits are issued must remain in balance with the capacity of the Redeemer network to absorb them. Too many credits chasing too few redemption offerings erodes value and destroys incentives. Too few credits stifles participation and interest.
